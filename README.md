Algorithms In A Nutshell
========================

### What is this?

This is my own personal implementation/interpretations of the algorithms
outlined in the book: Algorithms in a Nutshell(Heineman, Pollice, Selkow). None
of the code will be verbatim, but I will try to follow pretty close to the
pseudo-code implementations outlined in the book.

I'm starting somewhere in the middle, since I felt like I was glossing over the
details and really needed to write some code if I wanted it to sink in. I may
come back to the earlier chapters later.

I'm starting in JavaScript (node.js) for now, but I may experiment with
some other languages down the road.
